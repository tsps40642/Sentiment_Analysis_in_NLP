# Sentiment_Analysis_in_NLP

## Overview
Observing that media with different sides may report news about war in Ukraine with different points of view, we separate media into two sides including Russia friendly side: TASS, 
Moscow (media from Russia) and Ukraine friendly side: CNN, BBC(media from western country), 
and want to see how subjective the way they report by calculating the sentiment score and see the 
distribution of these scores.
